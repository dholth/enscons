# Enscons Documentation

Enscons provides a set of Builders and utility functions for [SCons](https://scons.org)
to build Python distribution wheels. It provides a [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)
build backend, compatible with popular build frontends such as Pip and
[Build](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Project Layout

To get started, your project must have at least these two files in the project's top level
directory: a `pyproject.toml` and an `SConstruct` file.

## pyproject.toml

At a minimum, your pyproject.toml file must contain the build-system requirements and
build-backend.

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["enscons"]
build-backend = "enscons.api"
```

This tells build frontends such as `pip` to build the package using Enscons. Add any other
*build-time* requirements to the requires list here. This should only list requirements needed
to build the wheel. Runtime dependencies should not be specified here.

It is recommended to add other static project metadata to a `[project]` section in this file
in accordance with the PyPA specification on
[Declaring Project Metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/#declaring-project-metadata)
Here's an example showing the essential items that Enscons knows about:

```toml
[project]
name = "distribution_name"
description = "Project Description"
version = "0.0.1"
license = "MIT"
authors = [
    {name = "Author Name", email = "authoremail@example.com"}
]
readme = "README.md"
requires-python: ">=3.8"
dependencies = ["click", "requests"]
keywords = ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
]
url = "https://example.com/myproject"

# This specifies the root directory which will be added to the python path when
# installing in editable mode (pip install -e).
src_root = "."

[tool.enscons.scripts]
my-script = "packagename.modulename:main"

[tool.enscons.optional-dependencies]
more = ["sphinx"]
```

### SConstruct

This file defines how to build your package. It may be helpful to familiarize yourself with
SCons by reading the [SCons Crash Course](https://github.com/SCons/scons/wiki/SConsCrashCourse)
but here's a quick primer:

SCons is a build utility similar to `make` but which uses a Python script to declare targets
and the dependency graph. This script is named `SConstruct` but may also be called
`SConstruct.py` or `sconstruct.py` which may be helpful to enable syntax highlighting
in your editor.

An SCons script defines *Builders* which will declare how to build *targets*
from *sources*. Sources and targets are typically files or directories, and are collectively
known as *nodes*. The nodes then form a dependency graph with the builders as edges.

A basic SConstruct file for building a Python wheel consists of an `Environment`, a `Whl`
builder, a `WhlFile` builder, and an `SDist` builder.

Here's a simple and complete example. The following sections will go over each part in more detail.

```python
import pytoml as  toml
import enscons

metadata = toml.load(open("pyproject.toml"))["project"]
tag = "py3-none-any"

env = Environment(
    tools=["default", "packaging", enscons.generate],
    PACKAGE_METADATA=metadata,
    WHEEL_TAG=tag,
)

py_sources = env.Glob("mypackage/*.py")

purelib = env.Whl("purelib", py_sources)
whl = env.WhlFile(purelib)
sdist = env.SDist(env.FindSourceFiles() + ["PKG-INFO", "README.md"])

# Sets the default target when scons is run on the command line with no target
env.Default(whl, sdist)
```

Note that the `Environment` class is not imported. It is injected into the script's globals
by the SCons runtime.

### Creating the Environment

The SConstruct `Environment` object should be created as shown:

```python
metadata = toml.load(open("pyproject.toml"))["project"]
tag = "py3-none-any"

env = Environment(
    tools=["default", "packaging", enscons.generate],
    PACKAGE_METADATA=metadata,
    WHEEL_TAG=tag,
)
```

The `tools` parameter defines which plugins are loaded into this environment. We'll want to
add the default and packaging tools provided by SCons, as well as the enscons tool, which loads
the enscons builders.

Additional keyword arguments set the Environment's *construction environment variables*. (this is
different than the system process's environment). Two variables are required:

The {py:data}`PACKAGE_METADATA` should typically come from the `pyproject.toml` file's
`[project]` section as shown, but doesn't have to.
Most
[project metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/#declaring-project-metadata)
keys are accepted and incorporated into
the wheel's metadata.

The wheel tag should be set to the compatibility tag of the wheel. See {py:data}`WHEEL_TAG`
for more information.

More environment variables may be defined, and are described in the [Environment Variables]
section.

### Environment Builders

```{eval-rst}
.. py:function:: env.Whl(category, source, root=None)

    Copies files into a temporary directory which holds the contents of the wheel.

    :param str category: "purelib", "platlib", "headers", "data", etc.
    :param source: files belonging to category
    :param root: relative to root directory, i.e. ".", "src"
    :returns: A list of file nodes for each file added

    This should be called at least once to add members into the wheel file. Typically, this
    would be called once to add all Python sources to the wheel. It may be called more
    than once to add additional sources to the wheel.

    For pure Python wheels, you'll typically want to use a :py:data:`WHEEL_TAG` ending in
    "none-any" in the environment, and set the ``category`` here to "purelib". Source
    files passed in will be copied into the root of the wheel.

    For wheels with a binary compiled or platform-specific component, you'll want to use "platlib"
    along with a platform-specific :py:data:`WHEEL_TAG`. Source files passed in will be
    copied into the root of the wheel.

    Any other category will add files into the corresponding subdirectory of the
    :py:data:`WHEEL_DATA_PATH` directory (e.g. ``projectname-0.0.1.data/category``)

    Returns a list of nodes for the files added to the wheel (both source files and metadata
    files). The returned nodes should later be passed in to :py:func:`env.WhlFile`
    as the list of sources.

    ``root`` determines the directory for which the sources are relative to. Source files are
    copied to the target directory along with all path components between ``root`` and the file
    itself.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:function:: env.WhlFile([target=None, ]source=None)

    Build the wheel archive from the given sources. If a single positional parameter is
    given, it is taken to be the ``source`` parameter.

    :param source: A list of file nodes to add to the wheel archive. Typically this is a list
        of nodes as returned from :py:func:`env.Whl` (or the concatenated list from all calls)

    :param str target: The path to the wheel file being created. By default this is
        :py:data:`WHEEL_FILE`

    :returns: A file node for the resulting wheel file.


    Calling this also adds the build target "bdist_wheel".
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:function:: env.SDist(target=None, source=None)

    Creates a source distribution

    :param target: The path to the source distribution output
    :param source: A list of source files to include
    :returns: The source dist node

    n.b. Only explicitly named sources are added to the source distribution. To make
    this easier, the :py:func:`env.FindSourceFiles()` function is convenient starting point.
    It discovers all files that are sources to some other SCons build target.

    You will need to explicitly add any other metadata files you want to include, such as
    ``PKG-INFO``, ``pyproject.toml``, ``SConstruct``, etc.
    (``PKG-INFO`` is automatically generated by enscons when named as a source)

    e.g.

    .. code-block:: python

        sdist = env.SDist(env.FindSourceFiles() + [
            "PKG-INFO", "README.md", "pyproject.toml", "SConstruct"
        ])

    Calling this also adds a build target named "sdist".
```

## Environment Variables

These variables are settable using kwargs to the `Environment()` constructor.

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: PACKAGE_METADATA

    Package metadata used by the rest of the wheel building code. This is typically pulled from
    the "project" section of the ``pyproject.toml`` file as shown

    .. code-block:: python

        metadata = toml.load(open("pyproject.toml"))["project"]

    This variable is required.

    Most items described in the
    `PyPA Project Metadata Specification <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/declaring-project-metadata/>`_
    are accepted and incorporated into the package's metadata.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: WHEEL_TAG

    This specifies the *compatibility tags* for the wheel being built, indicating the
    platform the wheel is compatible with. It is a hyphen-delimited string specifying the
    the *python tag*, *abi tag*, and *platform tag*.

    Common examples are ``py38-none-none`` for pure Python 3.8+, or
    ``cp38-abi3-manylinux2014_x86_64`` for Python 3.8+ with binary compiled libraries for
    linux x86_64 and conforming to the abi3 binary interface and manylinux2014 platform
    policy.

    This variable is required.

    .. note::
        The short-short version is to use the most preferred pure-python tag e.g.
        ``py38-none-any`` for pure-python wheels, or the most preferred architecture
        dependent tag e.g. the tag returned from :py:func:`enscons.get_binary_tag()`
        for wheels with compiled or architecture dependent components.

    Choosing the correct compatibility tags can be tricky. This section will serve
    as a brief guide on choosing the tags. Useful functions provided by the
    `Packaging <https://packaging.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html>`_
    library are referenced in this section.

    Python Tag
        This indicates which Python interpreter your distribution is compatible with.
        Common Python tags are ``py3`` for any Python 3 interpreter, ``cp3`` for
        CPython 3, ``py38`` / ``cp38`` for Python / CPython 3.8 and up.

        Builds targeting other Python interpreters would specify a different tag here.
        For example, PyPy uses ``pp``. The current interpreter's tag is returned by
        :py:func:`packaging.tags.interpreter_name()`.

        Additional info in PEP 425's section on `Python Tags <https://peps.python.org/pep-0425/#python-tag>`_

    ABI tag
        If your distribution includes compiled extension modules, this indicates the ABI required.

        If your distribution is pure-python, this should be set to ``none``. If your extension
        module is complied against e.g. CPython 3.8, this should generally be set to ``cp38``.

        If your extension modules conform to the
        `Python Limited API <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html>`_
        then you can use the ``abi3`` tag. This will allow wheels built for a previous version
        of Python to be compatible with newer versions, despite having compiled C extension
        modules.

    Platform Tag
        This tag encodes what your wheel requires of the rest of the computing environment,
        and is where you declare if it runs on e.g. Mac, Windows, or Linux.

        The compatibility tag specification can be found at the PyPA page on
        `Platform Compatibility Tags <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/>`_.
        Below is a brief synopsis.

        ``any`` is used for pure Python wheels which don't have any platform-specific components.

        Otherwise, this should encode the platform requirements. Common examples are:
        ``linux_x86_64``, ``win_amd64``, ``macosx_10_9_x86_64``.

        Since Linux platforms vary so wildly, wheels tagged with a generic ``linux_*`` are
        not uploadable to PyPI. Instead, standards for Linux compatibility called ``manylinux``
        are described in
        `PEP 600 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0600/>`_, and specific requirements for
        the latest ``manylinux2014`` policy are found in
        `PEP 599 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0599/>`_.

        It's recommended to build your wheels on CentOS7 for compatibility with
        the ``manylinux2014`` policy. This ensures compatilitiy with most modern Linux platforms.
        PyPA maintains a set of
        `Manylinux Docker Images <https://quay.io/organization/pypa>`_ for the purpose
        of building Linux wheels.

        A full Manylinux platform tag consists of the specific manylinux policy keyword and
        architecture, e.g. ``manylinux2014_x86_64`` or ``manylinux_2_17_x86_64``.

        Note that "manylinux2014" and "manylinux_2_17" are aliases of each other and
        refer to the same policy. The general tag form is ``manylinux_GLIBCMAJOR_GLIBCMINOR_ARCH``
        for compatibility with a minimum glibc version and architecture.

        The `Auditwheel <https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel>`_ tool can scan built wheels to
        determine if they use any symbols which do not conform to ``manylinux``.

        See which platforms your current interpreter supports with
        :py:func:`packaging.tags.platform_tags()`. The current architecture part of this tag
        comes from :py:func:`sysconfig.get_platform()` with period ``.`` and hyphen ``-``
        replaced with underscores ``_``.


    As a convenience, the following helper functions are available:

    .. py:function:: enscons.get_binary_tag()

        Returns the most specific binary tag for the current platform. Use this if built
        wheels are only guaranteed to run on the exact platform and interpreter that they were
        built on.

        *This should be the tag used for architecture-dependent wheels unless you specifically
        intend to provide cross-Python compatibility with other ABIs  and/or platforms.*

    .. py:function:: enscons.get_universal_tag()

        Returns "py2.py3-none-any" for a pure python distribution compatible with both Python 2
        and 3.

        You probably don't want to use this unless you're still supporting and testing on
        Python 2. Use ``py3-none-any`` for pure Python distributions supporting only Python 3.

    .. py:function:: enscons.get_abi3_tag()

        Returns the first abi3 tag, or the first binary tag if abi3 is not supported. Use this
        if compiled extension modules only access Python functions in accordance with the
        `Limited API <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html>`_.

        Note: If you're also targeting a manylinux platform, this function may not return the correct
        tag.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: WHEEL_PATH

    The temporary directory which to build the wheel contents. Files will be copied / generated
    in this directory, and zipped into a wheel file by the :py:func:`env.WhlFile` function.

    This should be set to a directory node (``env.Dir()``). By default it is set to
    ``env.Dir("#build/wheel/")``.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: ROOT_IS_PURELIB

    If the wheel to create is a pure-python library, this should be set to ``True``.

    By default, this is set to ``True`` if the :py:data:`WHEEL_TAG` ends in "none-any".

    This sets the ``Root-Is-Purelib`` line in the ``WHEEL`` metadata file, and also determines
    whether "platlib" or "purelib" calls to :py:func:`env.Whl` are copied into the wheel
    path (as opposed to a data directory)

```

## Command Line Options

The following command line options are available. Both the `Environment` variable and
the command line option are given for each option. e.g. `--wheel_dir=build` will be
available as `env["WHEEL_DIR"]`.

You will not usually need to set this. They are used by the PEP 517 backend to pass
information from the build frontend.

```{eval-rst}
.. option:: --wheel_dir WHEEL_DIR

    ``env["WHEEL_DIR"]``

    Sets the directory which to output generated wheel files.

    Default: "dist".
```

```{eval-rst}
.. option:: --dist_dir DIST_DIR

    ``env["DIST_BASE"]``

    Sets the directory which to output generated source distributions.

    Default: "dist"
```

```{eval-rst}
.. option:: --egg_base EGG_INFO_PREFIX

    ``env["EGG_INFO_PREFIX"]``

    Sets the directory prefix for the :py:data:`EGG_INFO_PATH` variable. If not set,
    the value is pulled from the package metadata's ``src_root`` value. If neither is set,
    the :py:data:`EGG_INFO_PATH` directory will be created in the current directory.
```

## Generated Environment Variables

These environment variables are available after the call to {py:meth}`env.Whl`.

These variables are not settable, and are used internally by enscons. They are provided
here as a reference.

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: WHEEL_DATA_PATH

    This is set to the ``<package name>-<package version>.data`` directory within
    :py:data:`WHEEL_PATH`
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: DIST_INFO_PATH

    This is set to the ``<package name>-<package version>.dist-info`` directory within
    :py:data:`WHEEL_PATH`
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: PACKAGE_NAME

    The ``name`` item from the :py:data:`PACKAGE_METADATA` dict.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: PACKAGE_NAME_SAFE

    The :py:data:`PACKAGE_NAME` value normalized for use as a valid filename. This is used
    as part of the wheel filename, as well as some metadata files within the wheel.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: PACKAGE_VERSION

    The ``version`` item from the :py:data:`PACKAGE_METADATA`
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: PACKAGE_NAMEVER

    The :py:data:`PACKAGE_NAME_SAFE` and :py:data:`PACKAGE_VERSION` variables concatenated
    with a hyphen.
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: WHEEL_FILE

    The final path to the wheel filename that will be generated. This is set to a file
    in the directory ``WHEEL_DIR`` with a filename generated from the package name,
    version, and compatibility tags. It can be overridden by setting the ``target`` parameter
    to :py:func:`env.WhlFile`
```

```{eval-rst}
.. py:data:: EGG_INFO_PATH

    Path where source dist metadata is built during the creation of a source distribution.
    It's set to a name generated from the package name with ".egg-info" appended to it.
    The directory is created either in the current directory or directory set by
    :option:`--egg_base`, or the value of the package metadata's ``src_root`` key.
```

## Building Your Wheel

As enscons implements a PEP 517 compatible build backend, it is recommended to use a similarly
compatible frontend, such as [Build](https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Install build with

```shell
$ pip install build
```

Then you can build your wheel with

```shell
$ python -m build
```

This will output a wheel file in the `dist/` directory by default.

You can also build any defined target using the `scons` command. e.g.

```shell
$ scons bdist_wheel
```
